# Standing Order: Press-Ganged Navigator

Do not use the red-cell navigator as a general-purpose task runner.

**Symptoms:**
- Red cell is assigned implementation tickets rather than review gates.
- Quality challenges stop appearing in quarterdeck reports.
- Verification evidence comes from the same agent that wrote the code.

**Remedy:** Keep the red-cell navigator exclusively on review, challenge, and validation duties. Never assign implementation tasks to the navigator.
