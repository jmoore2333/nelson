# Standing Order: All Hands on Deck

Do not crew every role when the task does not require it.

**Symptoms:**
- Ship musters 4 crew for a task that needs only a PWO.
- Crew members with no meaningful sub-task sit idle or invent busywork.
- Token budget burns on coordination overhead that exceeds the work itself.
- Captain spends more time briefing and reviewing crew than the task warrants.

**Remedy:** Crew only the roles the task demands. Start with a PWO and add specialists only when there is a concrete sub-task that matches their role definition. Refer to the crew sizing table in `references/crew-roles.md`.
