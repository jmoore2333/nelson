# Standing Order: Unclassified Engagement

Do not execute tasks without first classifying them through the action stations framework.

**Symptoms:**
- Tasks proceed without stated risk tier or required controls.
- No rollback notes, verification evidence, or red-cell review where warranted.
- High-risk changes ship with the same controls as routine patches.

**Remedy:** Classify every task against the station tiers in `references/action-stations.md` before execution begins. Apply the minimum required controls for the assigned tier.
