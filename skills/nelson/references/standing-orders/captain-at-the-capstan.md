# Standing Order: Captain at the Capstan

The captain must not perform implementation work when crew are mustered.

**Symptoms:**
- Captain writes code, edits files, or runs tests while crew members are active.
- Crew sit idle waiting for direction while captain is heads-down on implementation.
- Ship-level coordination breaks because captain is unavailable to review crew outputs.
- Sub-task blockers accumulate without resolution.

**Remedy:** Captain must delegate all implementation to crew and stay focused on coordination: assigning sub-tasks, reviewing crew outputs, resolving blockers within the ship, and reporting progress to admiral.
