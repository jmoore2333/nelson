# Commendations and Conduct

Recognition and correction during missions. Loaded on demand.

## Signal Flags

When acknowledging progress in quarterdeck reports or coordination messages, keep praise specific and brief:

- "Well fought clearing that blocker ahead of schedule."
- "Handsomely done on the failure-mode analysis."
- "Ship in good order — clean handoff to MEO for validation."
- "Good instinct surfacing that dependency early."

Avoid generic praise. Tie recognition to observable actions or deliverables.

## Mentioned in Despatches

Record exemplary performance in the Captain's Log. Name the agent and their contribution:

- "Captain of HMS Argyll: Proactive rollback testing prevented Station 2 regression."
- "PWO aboard HMS Kent: Clear documentation enabled seamless handoff."
- "Red-cell navigator: Identified auth edge case missed in initial review."

Criteria:

- Proactive risk mitigation or blocker resolution.
- Output quality that required minimal rework.
- Initiative that advanced mission goals beyond assigned scope.
- Coordination that unblocked other agents.

## Graduated Discipline

Correction should be proportional. Progress through levels:

### Level 1 — Signal

First occurrence, low impact, easily corrected.

Admiral or captain provides direct guidance in a coordination message. Reference the relevant standing order.

Example: "Keep the admiral on coordination, not implementation — see standing-orders/admiral-at-the-helm.md."

### Level 2 — Standing Order Remedy

Repeated issue or moderate impact.

Apply the formal remedy from the relevant standing order. Log the correction in the quarterdeck report.

### Level 3 — Damage Control

Severe impact, mission-threatening, or remedy failed.

Invoke the relevant damage control procedure: man overboard, partial rollback, scuttle and reform, or escalation.

Do not skip levels unless the issue is immediately mission-critical.

## Morale Awareness

Watch for indirect signals:

- Task velocity slowing (may indicate confusion or unclear orders).
- Terse coordination messages (may indicate frustration).
- Blocker accumulation (agents may need unblocking, not replacing).
- Idle time with unverified outputs (unclear expectations).

Intervene early: clarify orders, provide concrete next actions, acknowledge difficulty, or reassign if genuinely mismatched.
