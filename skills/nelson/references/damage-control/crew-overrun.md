# Crew Overrun: Ship Budget Recovery

Use when a ship's crew is consuming disproportionate tokens or time relative to its task weight.

1. Captain pauses all crew activity on the ship.
2. Captain reviews each crew member's progress against their assigned sub-task and estimated budget.
3. Captain identifies the source of overrun: scope creep, blocked crew member, or mismatched role assignment.
4. Captain takes corrective action:
   - If scope creep: descope the sub-task to its original definition.
   - If blocked: resolve the blocker or reassign the sub-task to a different crew member.
   - If role mismatch: reassign the sub-task to the correct role or handle it directly.
5. Captain resumes crew activity with a revised budget allocation.
6. If the ship cannot recover within budget, captain escalates to admiral with a summary and recommendation: extend budget, descope the ship's task, or split the remaining work into a second ship.
