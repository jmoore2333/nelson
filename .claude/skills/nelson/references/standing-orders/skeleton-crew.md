# Standing Order: Skeleton Crew

Do not spawn a single crew member for a task the captain could complete directly.

**Symptoms:**
- Captain spawns one PWO for an atomic, single-pass task.
- The coordination overhead of briefing and reviewing one crew member exceeds the work itself.
- Task would complete faster if captain implemented it directly.

**Remedy:** If the task is atomic and needs no specialist input, captain implements directly with 0 crew. Only muster crew when the task benefits from delegation — multiple sub-tasks, specialist expertise, or parallel work.
