# Standing Order: Split Keel

Do not assign the same file to multiple captains.

**Symptoms:**
- Captains overwrite each other's changes.
- Frequent merge conflicts on the same artifact.
- Admiral spends coordination time reconciling divergent edits.

**Remedy:** Assign exclusive file ownership in the battle plan. If two tasks must touch the same file, serialize them or split the file into independent modules first.
