# Standing Order: Pressed Crew

Do not assign crew members work outside their designated role.

**Symptoms:**
- A Navigating Officer is asked to write implementation code.
- A PWO is asked to run tests instead of the MEO.
- A read-only role (NO or COX) is expected to modify files.
- Crew members produce lower-quality output because they lack the tools or context for the assigned work.

**Remedy:** Each crew role has a defined function and subagent type. Assign sub-tasks that match the role definition in `references/crew-roles.md`. If no crewed role fits the sub-task, the captain should either crew the appropriate role or handle it directly.
