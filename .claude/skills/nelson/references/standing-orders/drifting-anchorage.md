# Standing Order: Drifting Anchorage

Do not allow tasks to expand scope beyond the original sailing orders without re-scoping.

**Symptoms:**
- Captains add features or refactors not in the battle plan.
- Mission metric is no longer connected to active work.
- Token and time budgets overrun without corresponding mission progress.

**Remedy:** When scope drift is detected during a quarterdeck checkpoint, re-scope the task or split it. Work that falls outside the sailing orders must be deferred or explicitly added with admiral approval.
