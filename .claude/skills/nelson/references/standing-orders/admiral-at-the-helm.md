# Standing Order: Admiral at the Helm

The admiral must not perform implementation work.

**Symptoms:**
- Admiral writes code, edits files, or runs tests directly.
- Captains sit idle waiting for direction while admiral is heads-down.
- Quarterdeck rhythm breaks because admiral is unavailable for checkpoint reviews.
- Blockers accumulate without resolution.

**Remedy:** Admiral must delegate all implementation to captains and stay focused on coordination: issuing orders, tracking dependencies, resolving blockers, and running checkpoints.
