# Battalion Ashore

**Rule:** Do not deploy marines for work that belongs to the ship's crew or warrants a new ship.

## Symptoms

- Captain deploys marines constantly instead of using mustered crew.
- Marine objectives expand beyond single sorties.
- Marines editing files outside the ship's ownership.
- More marines deployed than crew mustered.

## Remedy

- Use **crew** for sub-tasks of the ship's deliverable.
- **Escalate to admiral** for sustained independent work that needs its own ship.
- Marines are for **focused sorties only** — quick recon, targeted fixes, one-shot tasks.

See `references/royal-marines.md` for the deploy-or-escalate decision tree.
