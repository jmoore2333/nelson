</p>

A Claude Code skill for coordinating agent work based on the Royal Navy. It provides structured sailing orders, battle plans, action stations, and a captain's log to manage complex tasks — from single-session work through to parallel subagent squadrons.

## What it does

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2468679d-39f5-4efb-9d93-43d43eee8907

Nelson gives Claude a six-step operational framework for tackling complex missions:

1. **Sailing Orders** — Define the outcome, success metric, constraints, and stop criteria
2. **Form the Squadron** — Choose an execution mode (single-session, subagents, or agent team) and size the team
3. **Battle Plan** — Split the mission into independent tasks with owners, dependencies, and file ownership
4. **Quarterdeck Rhythm** — Run checkpoints to track progress, identify blockers, and manage budget
5. **Action Stations** — Classify tasks by risk tier and enforce verification before marking complete
6. **Stand Down** — Produce a captain's log with decisions, artifacts, validation evidence, and follow-ups

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed and authenticated
- **Recommended:** Enable [agent teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) for the full squadron experience. Nelson works without it (using single-session or subagent modes), but agent teams unlock teammate-to-teammate coordination — the `agent-team` execution mode. Enable it in your [settings.json](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

- **For split-pane visibility:** To see each agent working in its own pane (as shown in the demo video), run Claude Code inside [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). Agent teams auto-detect tmux and give every teammate a dedicated split pane so you can watch the whole squadron in action.

## Installation

### Plugin install (recommended)

```
/plugin install harrymunro/nelson
```

Or add the marketplace first, then install by name:

```
/plugin marketplace add harrymunro/nelson
/plugin install nelson@nelson-marketplace
```

### Prompt-based

Open Claude Code and say:

```
Install skills from https://github.com/harrymunro/nelson
```

Claude will clone the repo, copy the skill into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory, and clean up. To install it globally across all projects, ask Claude to install it to `~/.claude/skills/` instead.

### Manual

Clone the repo and copy the skill directory yourself:

```bash
# Project-level (recommended for teams)
git clone https://github.com/harrymunro/nelson.git /tmp/nelson
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -r /tmp/nelson/skills/nelson .claude/skills/nelson
rm -rf /tmp/nelson

# Or user-level (personal, all projects)
cp -r /tmp/nelson/skills/nelson ~/.claude/skills/nelson
```

Then commit `.claude/skills/nelson/` to version control so your team can use it.

### Verify installation

Open Claude Code and ask:

```
What skills are available?
```

You should see `nelson` listed. You can also invoke it directly:

```
/nelson
```

## Usage

### Let Claude invoke it automatically

Claude reads the skill description and loads it when your request matches — for example, when you ask for coordinated parallel work or structured mission execution. Just describe your task:

```
I need to refactor the authentication system. The work spans the API layer,
the frontend, and the test suite. Use nelson to coordinate this.
```

### Invoke it directly

Use the slash command with your mission brief:

```
/nelson Migrate the payment processing module from Stripe v2 to v3
```

### Provide structured sailing orders

For maximum control, provide your own sailing orders:

```
/nelson

Sailing orders:
- Outcome: All API endpoints return consistent error responses
- Success metric: Zero test failures, all error responses match the schema
- Deadline: This session

Constraints:
- Token/time budget: Stay under 50k tokens
- Forbidden actions: Do not modify the database schema

Scope:
- In scope: src/api/ and tests/api/
- Out of scope: Frontend error handling
```

</p>

### Execution modes

The skill selects one of three execution modes based on your mission:

| Mode | When to use | How it works |
|------|------------|--------------|
| `single-session` | Sequential tasks, low complexity, heavy same-file editing | Claude works through tasks in order within one session |
| `subagents` | Parallel tasks where workers only report back to the coordinator | Claude spawns [subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) that work independently and return results |
| `agent-team` | Parallel tasks where workers need to coordinate with each other | Claude creates an [agent team](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) with direct teammate-to-teammate communication |

### Chain of command

Nelson uses a three-tier hierarchy. The admiral coordinates captains, each captain commands a named ship, and crew members aboard each ship do the specialist work.

```
                          ┌───────────┐
                          │  Admiral  │
                          └─────┬─────┘
                  ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
                  ▼             ▼             ▼
           ┌───────────┐ ┌───────────┐ ┌───────────┐
           │  Captain   │ │  Captain   │ │ Red-Cell  │
           │ HMS Daring │ │ HMS Kent   │ │ Navigator │
           └─────┬─────┘ └─────┬─────┘ └───────────┘
            ┌────┼────┐   ┌────┼────┐
            ▼    ▼    ▼   ▼    ▼    ▼
           XO  PWO  MEO  PWO  NO  COX
```

**Squadron level:**

- **Admiral** — Coordinates the mission, delegates tasks, resolves blockers, produces the final synthesis. There is always exactly one.
- **Captains** — Each commands a named ship. Breaks their task into sub-tasks, crews specialist roles, coordinates crew, and verifies outputs. Implements directly only when the task is atomic. Typically 2-7 per mission.
- **Red-cell navigator** — Challenges assumptions, validates outputs, and checks rollback readiness. Added for medium/high risk work.

**Ship level (crew per captain, 0-4 members):**

| Role | Abbr | Function | When to crew |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| Executive Officer | XO | Integration & orchestration | 3+ crew or interdependent sub-tasks |
| Principal Warfare Officer | PWO | Core implementation | Almost always (default doer) |
| Navigating Officer | NO | Codebase research & exploration | Unfamiliar code, large codebase |
| Marine Engineering Officer | MEO | Testing & validation | Station 1+ or non-trivial verification |
| Weapon Engineering Officer | WEO | Config, infrastructure & systems integration | Significant config/infra work |
| Logistics Officer | LOGO | Documentation & dependency management | Docs as deliverable, dep management |
| Coxswain | COX | Standards review & quality | Station 1+ with established conventions |

NO and COX are read-only — they report findings but never modify files.

Ships are named from real Royal Navy warships, matched roughly to task weight: frigates for general-purpose, destroyers for high-tempo, patrol vessels for small tasks, historic flagships for critical-path, and submarines for research.

Squadron size caps at 10 squadron-level agents (admiral, captains, red-cell navigator). Crew are additional — up to 4 per ship. If a task needs more crew, split it into two ships.

Here's an example of the crew in action: we create four captains. Two of the captains are single-crew (minimum, since captains don't do the work themselves) and two of them are two-crew. So we have 11 agents working together in total:

### Action stations (risk tiers)

Every task is classified into a risk tier before execution. Higher tiers require more controls:

| Station | Name | When | Required controls |
|---------|------|------|-------------------|
| 0 | Patrol | Low blast radius, easy rollback | Basic validation, rollback step |
| 1 | Caution | User-visible changes, moderate impact | Independent review, negative test, rollback note |
| 2 | Action | Security/compliance/data integrity implications | Red-cell review, failure-mode checklist, go/no-go checkpoint |
| 3 | Trafalgar | Irreversible actions, regulated/safety-sensitive | Minimal scope, human confirmation, two-step verification, contingency plan |

Tasks at Station 1 and above also run a **failure-mode checklist**:

- What could fail in production?
- How would we detect it quickly?
- What is the fastest safe rollback?
- What dependency could invalidate this plan?
- What assumption is least certain?

### Templates

The skill includes structured templates for consistent output across missions:

- **Sailing Orders** — Mission definition with outcome, constraints, scope, and stop criteria
- **Battle Plan** — Task breakdown with owners, dependencies, threat tiers, and validation requirements
- **Ship Manifest** — Captain's crew plan with ship name, crew roles, sub-tasks, and budget
- **Quarterdeck Report** — Checkpoint status with progress, blockers, budget tracking, and risk updates
- **Red-Cell Review** — Adversarial review with challenge summary, checks, and recommendation
- **Captain's Log** — Final report with delivered artifacts, decisions, validation evidence, and follow-ups

- `plugin.json` declares the plugin name, version, and component paths for Claude Code's plugin system.
- `marketplace.json` lets users add this repo as a plugin marketplace and install Nelson by name.
- `SKILL.md` is the entrypoint that Claude reads when the skill is invoked. It defines the six-step workflow and references the supporting files.
- Files in `references/` contain detailed guidance that Claude loads on demand — they are not all loaded into context at once.

## Customisation

### Modify templates

Edit the individual template files in `references/admiralty-templates/` to match your team's reporting style. The templates use plain text format — adjust fields, add sections, or remove what you don't need.

### Adjust risk tiers

Edit `references/action-stations.md` to change what controls are required at each station level. For example, you might require red-cell review at Station 1 instead of Station 2 for a security-sensitive project.

### Change team sizing

Edit `references/squadron-composition.md` to adjust the decision matrix or default team sizes.

## Compatibility notes

- **Subagents** are a stable Claude Code feature and work out of the box.
- **Agent teams** are experimental and disabled by default. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above for setup. Without agent teams enabled, Nelson falls back to `single-session` or `subagents` mode. Full details: [Agent teams documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams).
